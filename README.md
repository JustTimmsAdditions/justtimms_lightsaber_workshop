## 🔍 Overview

This pack replaces every sword type in Minecraft with fully 3D-modeled lightsabers, depending on their name. In addition, a **stick** can be renamed to display just the **lightsaber hilt**, and some models also replace the **bow** for blaster-like functionality. Each item uses the `custom_name` selector to activate a specific model and color.

- 🎨Vanilla styled custom 3D models
- ⚡Works without mods (vanilla-compatible)
- 🛠 Utilizing Custom Name Components _(Vanilla CIT)_
