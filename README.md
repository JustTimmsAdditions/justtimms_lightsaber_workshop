- 🛠 Powered by `minecraft:select` & `custom_name`
- ✨ Great for datapacks, servers, and creative builds

2. Place the `.zip` in your Minecraft `resourcepacks` folder.

## 🧪 How to Use

## 🧰 Customization Guide

You can add your own lightsabers or modify existing ones by editing the `item.override` JSON files and adding new models/textures.

### Basic Steps:
- Add your new model to the `models/item/` directory.
- Update the `overrides` section with a new `predicate` for the `custom_model_data` or `custom_name`.
- Use an anvil to assign the new name to your in-game item.
